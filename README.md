# ValkyRiver: upgrademod
**upgrademod** is a [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/) mod by ValkyRiver which allows every item in the Collection to be upgraded (except for decks, but there are 3 new decks)

The first version of this mod is complete now. Only a bit of testing left. At the moment, the ante scaling on the other decks is a bit low, especially with upgrade items now in the game.

This mod has been tested on 1.0.0\~ALPHA-0813a-STEAMODDED, 1.0.0\~ALPHA-0919a-STEAMODDED, and 1.0.0\~ALPHA-0927a-STEAMODDED.

**Note: upgrademod is quite different from most other mods — instead of adding new jokers or consumables etc. to the game, it alters (upgrades) every item in the vanilla game. Because of that, it is probably not going to be compatible with many other mods, and even if it were, the items in the other mod wouldn’t be upgradeable at this moment.**

### Current Progress:
• All Jokers have upgrades

• All consumables have upgrades

• All enhancements, editions, and seals have upgrades

• All vanilla booster packs have upgrades

• All Tags have upgrades

• All Vouchers have upgrades 

• Higher-level blinds have higher scoring requirements

• All bosses are affected by blind level (and Chicot / Luchador)

• There are 3 new decks: Level 2 Deck, Level 3 Deck, and Level 4 Deck

• A separate tab to view current upgrade levels

• All implemented items have modified descriptions

• Collection tabs have a "level select" UI

• There are 13 new "Upgrade" items, each of which upgrades one kind of item in the collection

• Within a run, one can pick up the "Choose an Upgrade" item, where one can choose between three different upgrade items (Note: If you have not used an upgrade in this Ante, then this item is guaranteed to appear on the shop before the Boss Blind)

• Custom music while in the "Choose an Upgrade" item (Music by ValkyRiver)

### Yet to be completed:
• Do some test runs on the Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4 decks at various stakes. At the moment, the ante scaling on the other decks is a bit low, especially with upgrade items now in the game.

## Upgrade categories
In this mod, the items in the Collection are split into 14 categories:

• +Mult Jokers (Common upgrade)

• XMult Jokers (Uncommon upgrade)

• Chips Jokers (Common upgrade)

• Econ Jokers (Common upgrade)

• Effect Jokers (Uncommon upgrade)

• Tarot Cards (Common upgrade)

• Planet Cards (Common upgrade)

• Spectral Cards (Uncommon upgrade)

• Enhancements (Rare upgrade)

• Editions and Seals (Rare upgrade)

• Booster Packs (Rare upgrade)

• Tags (Uncommon upgrade)

• Vouchers (Rare upgrade)

• Blinds (Deck only)

The first 13 categories can be upgraded during a run by choosing an upgrade using the "Choose an Upgrade" item. Higher-level blinds can only be found by using the Level 2, Level 3, or Level 4 decks. Some items (mostly items with non-numerical effects) have a maximum effective level, where upgrading the item to anything higher doesn't make a difference. Other items can be scaled indefinitely by upgrading them.

## Known bugs

• Cerulean Bell doesn't function properly when exiting and reentering a run

• Drawing Negative playing cards in a booster pack can occasionally cause hand size to be reduced in the next blind

## Potential compatibility issues (yet to be resolved)

• There is a lot of overwriting in this mod, mostly because Steamodded overwrites all of the files in the "functions" folder (so using lovely.toml doesn't work)
